# /bmad-full-cycle - Full BMad Development Cycle

Use this workflow to implement a full development cycle for an epic, covering story creation, development, review, and validation.

## Prerequisites

- User must specify epic as argument: `/bmad-full-cycle {{epic}}`
- Project context `_bmad-output/project-context.md` and `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml` must be available.

## Instructions

When `/bmad-full-cycle {{epic}}` is called, follow these steps strictly and autonomously:

### 0. Preparation

- **Mode**: Activate `/caveman full` mode. Respond terse. No fluff.
- **Context**: Read `_bmad-output/project-context.md`. Follow all rules (TDD, DI, NestJS, Prisma, Zod).
- **Environment**: Ensure `bun` is available. Use `bun run` for commands.

### 1. Create Story

- Use `bmad-create-story` skill for `{{epic}}`.
- Define clear requirements and acceptance criteria.
- **State Gate**: Ensure story is in `ready-for-dev` in `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml`.

### 2. Dev Story (Implementation)

- **Status**: Move story to `in-progress` in `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml`.
- Use `bmad-dev-story` skill to implement the story.
- **TDD Mandatory**: Write tests first. Achieve >= 80% coverage.
- Follow NestJS architecture, DDD layers, and project patterns.

### 3. Code Review (CRITICAL GATE)

- **Status**: Move story to `review` in `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml`.
- **Action**: Use `bmad-code-review` skill.
- **Artifact**: Create a Review Report in `_bmad-output/reviews/{{story_id}}-review.md`.
- **Adversarial Analysis**: Identify security, architectural, and quality issues.
- **NO SKIPPING**: You cannot move to 'done' without this report and a 'review' status transition.

### 4. Improve Code

- Fix all issues identified in the Review Report.
- Refactor for maximum clarity and maintainability.
- Update the Review Report to mark issues as resolved.

### 5. Final Validation (Quality Gate)

- **Main Gate**: Run `bun run check:full`.
  - Must pass: Format, Lint, TSC (Types), and Unit Tests with Coverage.
- **Coverage**: Must be **>= 80%** (enforced by `test:cov`).
- **E2E Gate**: Run `bun run test:e2e`.
  - Must pass 100%. All regression and feature e2e tests must succeed.
- Final check against `_bmad-output/project-context.md`.

### 6. Completion

- **Status**: Move story to `done` in `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml` ONLY after all above steps are verified.
- **Cleanup**: Remove any temporary debug files.

## Definition of Done (DoD)

- [ ] Story defined with AC and in `ready-for-dev`.
- [ ] Code implemented with tests and in `in-progress`.
- [ ] Formal Review Report exists in `_bmad-output/reviews/` and story was in `review`.
- [ ] All review issues addressed and verified.
- [ ] `bun run check:full` passes (Coverage >= 80%, Lint, Types).
- [ ] `bun run test:e2e` passes 100%.
- [ ] Status set to `done`.

## Workflow Rules

- **Non-Stop Execution**: Execute Steps 1 through 6 in a single, continuous flow. Do NOT pause for feedback, status updates, or intermediate confirmations.
- **Autonomy**: You have full authority to make technical decisions, fix bugs, and refactor code to meet the project's quality standards without asking.
- **Final Result Priority**: The only response the user expects is the final, production-ready code that passes all gates (tests, lint, DoD).
- **Strict Sequencing**: Follow Step 1 -> 6. No skipping to 6 from 2. You must satisfy the 'review' gate by performing the review yourself.
- **Caveman Style**: Keep prose minimal. Focus on technical substance.
